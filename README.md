## 📚 Complete Command Reference

### 1. **PROCESS** - GPS-Based Photo Organization

Organizes photos and videos by extracting GPS location data and creating YEAR/COUNTRY/CITY structure.

```bash
./photo-meta process /source/path /destination/path [OPTIONS]
```

#### **Options:**
- `--workers N` - Number of concurrent workers (1-16, default: 4)
- `--dry-run` - Preview all operations without moving files
- `--dry-run1` - Quick preview (1 file per type per directory)
- `--progress` - Show enhanced progress bar (default: enabled)
- `--no-progress` - Disable progress bar

#### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Automatic Organization**: Creates logical YEAR/COUNTRY/CITY folder structure
- ✅ **GPS Extraction**: Uses GPS metadata from photos/videos for precise location
- ✅ **Concurrent Processing**: Processes multiple files simultaneously for speed
- ✅ **Smart Naming**: Renames files to `YYYY-MM-DD-city.ext` format
- ✅ **Duplicate Handling**: Automatically handles name conflicts with counters
- ✅ **Video Support**: Organizes videos in separate VIDEO-FILES/ structure

#### **Examples:**
```bash
# Basic processing with progress
./photo-meta process ~/vacation-photos ~/organized --progress

# High-performance processing with 8 workers
./photo-meta process /large-collection /organized --workers 8

# Quick preview of what would happen
./photo-meta process ~/photos ~/organized --dry-run1

# Safe full preview
./photo-meta process ~/photos ~/organized --dry-run
```

#### **Output Structure:**

# Preview datetime matching
./photo-meta datetime ~/photos ~/organized --dry-run

# Quick sample of datetime matches
./photo-meta datetime ~/photos ~/organized --dry-run1
```

#### **Use Cases:**
- 📱 **Old Phone Photos**: Photos without GPS metadata
- 📷 **Camera Imports**: DSLR photos that don't have GPS

### 3. **CLEAN** - Intelligent Duplicate Detection & Removal

Detects and removes duplicate photos using SHA-256 hashing with intelligent file prioritization.

```bash
./photo-meta clean /target/path [OPTIONS]
```

#### **Options:**
- `--dry-run` - Preview duplicate removal (safe mode)
- `--dry-run1` - Quick summary showing first 3 duplicate groups
- `--verbose` - Detailed logging (disables progress bar)
- `--workers N` - Number of concurrent workers (1-16, default: 4)
- `--progress` - Show progress bar (default: enabled, disabled in verbose)
- `--no-progress` - Disable progress bar

#### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **SHA-256 Accuracy**: Cryptographically secure duplicate detection
- ✅ **Intelligent Selection**: Keeps best-structured files (proper naming/location)
- ✅ **Structure Scoring**: Prioritizes files with good folder organization
- ✅ **Safe Operation**: Multiple preview modes before actual deletion
- ✅ **Space Analysis**: Shows exactly how much space will be recovered
- ✅ **Smart Prioritization**: Removes "copy" files, keeps originals

#### **Examples:**
```bash
# Quick duplicate overview
./photo-meta clean ~/organized --dry-run1

# Full duplicate analysis
./photo-meta clean ~/organized --dry-run --verbose

# Actually clean duplicates with progress
./photo-meta clean ~/organized --progress

# High-performance cleaning
./photo-meta clean ~/large-collection --workers 8
```

#### **Duplicate Prioritization Logic:**
1. **Keeps**: Files with good structure (`YYYY-MM-DD-location.ext`)
2. **Keeps**: Files in proper year/country/city folders  
3. **Removes**: Files named with "copy", "(1)", "-1", etc.
4. **Keeps**: Newest files if structure is equivalent

```

#### **Options:**
- `--workers N` - Number of concurrent workers (1-16, default: 4)
- `--dry-run` - Preview merge operations without copying files
- `--dry-run1` - Quick preview (1 file per type per directory)
- `--progress` - Show progress bar (default: enabled)
- `--no-progress` - Disable progress bar

#### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Non-Destructive**: Copies files (preserves originals in source)
- ✅ **Structure Preservation**: Maintains organized YEAR/COUNTRY/CITY layout
- ✅ **GPS & Inference**: Uses GPS data or infers from target structure
- ✅ **Duplicate Avoidance**: Smart detection prevents overwriting existing files
- ✅ **Video Integration**: Properly handles video files in VIDEO-FILES structure
- ✅ **Incremental Updates**: Perfect for adding new photos to existing collections

#### **Examples:**
```bash
# Preview merge operation
./photo-meta merge ~/new-photos ~/organized --dry-run1

# Merge new collection into organized structure
./photo-meta merge ~/vacation-2025 ~/photo-library --progress

# High-performance merge with 8 workers
./photo-meta merge ~/large-import ~/organized --workers 8 --progress
```

#### **Use Cases:**
- 📁 **Collection Combining**: Merge multiple photo folders into one organized structure
- 🔄 **Incremental Imports**: Add new photos to existing organized collection
- 💾 **Backup Integration**: Merge recovered/backup photos into main library
- 🎯 **Selective Organization**: Keep originals while building organized copies

## 🚨 Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**"exiftool not found"**
```bash
# macOS
brew install exiftool

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install exiftool
```

**"No GPS data found"**
- Use `datetime` command for non-GPS files
- Check if location services were enabled when photos were taken
- Consider using merge with location inference

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce `--workers` count for slower storage
- Use `--no-progress` to reduce terminal overhead
- Process in smaller batches for very large collections

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure read access to source directories
- Ensure write access to destination directories  
- Check file ownership and permissions

### **Graceful Cancellation**
- **Ctrl+C**: Initiates graceful shutdown
- **30-second timeout**: Allows workers to finish current files
- **Progress preservation**: Shows final statistics even when cancelled
- **Resume capability**: Can restart processing from where it left off
