üìä Fallback Processing Summary:
‚úÖ Total files processed: 8
üì∑ Photos processed: 6
üé• Videos processed: 2 (moved to VIDEO-FILES/)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Files unmatched: 0

=== 2. Testing fallback command --dry-run mode (full processing overview) ===

The fallback command successfully processes all media files that have extractable dates in their filenames.

Key Features Demonstrated:
1. Date Extraction: Successfully extracts dates from various filename patterns:
   - DD-MM-YYYY format: 03-03-2009-DSCF4300.JPG ‚Üí 2009-03-03
   - YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format: 20250831120839.HEIC ‚Üí 2025-08-31

2. Directory Organization:
   - Photos: Organized into YYYY/MonthName structure (e.g., 2009/March, 2018/October)
   - Videos: Organized into VIDEO-FILES/YYYY/MonthName structure

3. Filename Standardization:
   - All files renamed to YYYY-MM-DD.ext format
   - Preserves original file extensions
   - Handles duplicate filenames with counter suffixes

4. File Type Handling:
   - Photos: JPG, JPEG, HEIC, PNG files placed in regular year/month structure
   - Videos: MOV, MP4 files placed in VIDEO-FILES/year/month structure

=== 3. Full Test Results Summary ===

üìä Fallback Processing Summary:
‚úÖ Total files processed: 146
üì∑ Photos processed: 141
üé• Videos processed: 5 (moved to VIDEO-FILES/)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Files unmatched: 0

The test demonstrates 100% success rate for files with extractable dates.

=== 4. Directory Structure Analysis ===

Input Structure (sample files):
/tmp/photos/2009/March/03-03-2009-DSCF4300.JPG
/tmp/photos/2018/October/10-10-2018-DSC_0996.JPG
/tmp/photos/2020/April/22-04-2020-IMG-20200422-WA0005.jpeg
/tmp/photos/2025 Sept majorca/20250901202923.HEIC

Expected Output Structure:
/tmp/dest/2009/March/2009-03-03.JPG
/tmp/dest/2018/October/2018-10-10.JPG
/tmp/dest/2020/April/2020-04-22.jpeg
/tmp/dest/2025/September/2025-09-01.HEIC
/tmp/dest/VIDEO-FILES/2025/September/2025-09-02.MOV

=== 5. Supported Date Formats ===

The fallback command successfully handles these filename date patterns:
1. DD-MM-YYYY-* format (e.g., 10-10-2018-DSC_0996.JPG)
2. YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format (e.g., 20250831120839.HEIC) 
3. YYYY-MM-DD format (already standardized)
4. YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20180310-IMG.jpg)

=== 6. Month Name Mapping ===

Numbers to full English month names:
01 ‚Üí January, 02 ‚Üí February, 03 ‚Üí March, 04 ‚Üí April
05 ‚Üí May, 06 ‚Üí June, 07 ‚Üí July, 08 ‚Üí August  
09 ‚Üí September, 10 ‚Üí October, 11 ‚Üí November, 12 ‚Üí December

=== TEST VALIDATION ===

‚úÖ Date extraction from multiple filename patterns
‚úÖ Year/month directory organization 
‚úÖ Standardized YYYY-MM-DD filename format
‚úÖ Separate video file organization in VIDEO-FILES/
‚úÖ Dry-run preview functionality
‚úÖ Dry-run1 sampling functionality
‚úÖ 100% processing success rate for dated files
‚úÖ No interactive prompts (fully automated)
‚úÖ Duplicate filename handling with counter suffixes

=== CONCLUSION ===

The fallback command provides a robust solution for organizing media files based on extractable dates when location-based organization is not possible. It successfully processes all common filename date patterns and organizes files into a clean YYYY/Month structure with standardized naming.
